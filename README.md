## NFTs for Nature Photography of Butterflies

### NFT Contract address on florencenet : KT1MCUj5WPt1ULfwctXGrmZxTUsh8EbC77ok

We are proposing a novel NFT ecosystem for Nature lovers and collection enthusiasts. Users can photograph various butterfly species and create a huge collection of these to supply into the marketplace. Further curation by qualified personnel will be done to classify these photographs into proper species (scientific nomenclature). This will enable us to host an exclusive gallery with a niche and limited quantity of each of the individual species.

### Whitepaper 
https://github.com/shri4net/tezos-nft/blob/main/assets/crypto_butterflies_whitepaper.pdf

We envision to build an NFT and DAO ecosystem targeted towards Nature photography, specifically Butterflies here.
The white paper enclosed has details of the vision and roadmap. The current codebase however only implements the minting and setup of the NFT contracts for simple fixed price sale. Further workflow related to Curation and DAO are still in the works.
